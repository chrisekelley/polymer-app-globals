app-globals
================

polymer element for managing globals

See the [component page](https://github.com/chrisekelley/polymer-app-globals) for more information.

## Getting Started

See the [Supporting global variables](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html#global) section in the 
Polymer API guide for usage info.

In your form, declare the element:

      <app-globals id="globals"></app-globals>

We've put together a [guide for app-globals](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html) to help get you rolling.
